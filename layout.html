            <h2>Smart Assistant using Python</h2>
            <p>Description: I designed and built a smart assistant using Python that can perform various tasks through both voice commands and text messages. The assistant is capable of browsing the internet, sending messages, operating the system, and more, all through natural language processing (NLP). The assistant also has a customizable wake word feature using Snowboy, allowing the user to activate it by saying a specific phrase or through a text message. I utilized various libraries, including SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, pywhattkit, wikipedia, and Os, to enable these features. Additionally, I implemented a conversation management system using NLP techniques with the NLTK library, allowing the assistant to understand and respond to user queries in a more conversational and natural manner.</p>
